## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I don't feel that I learned anything, but rather that I reinforced knwledge from doing the stats preview card component project and figured out how to optomize my workflow better. While the first project took me a little over 7 days, this one took me about 10-12 hours to create a responsive card that I was pleased with.

### Continued development
 In future projects, I plan to work on a system so that I can finish simple sites like this in 5 hours or less. This will take more practice and a better undertsanding of how properties work with each other, but I am prepared to put in the time to get further optomize my workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Screen Sizes](https://screensiz.es/) - This helped me to come up with appropriate minimum and maximum widths in my media queries. While I also made sure to test when the site began to look bad as that is the proper practice for creating media queries, I also used this as a guide so I knew which numbers to start with.
